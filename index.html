<h1> About Me</h1> 
<p> My name is Paige Schmidt. I am a soon-to-be graduate, with degrees in Animal Science and 
Technical Communication from Iowa State University.
My goal is to pair my technical skills with my passion for agriculture to support our farmers 
and to educate our youth. </P>

<h2> Interests and Experiences </H2> 
<p>As a homegrown Iowan, I have had exposure to almost every type of agriculture known to the state. 
From dairy cattle, to goats, to poultry, to swine, to crops - I have seen it all. I know how much
work goes into supporting these industries, and I also know just how little the general public understands
about it. I want to address that knowledge gap, to better inform our citizens about the industries that 
drive our state, and to better support the farmers responsible for it all. </P>
<p>In the specialization of my studies, the swine industry has become my focus. While I have interest in 
many other sectors of agriculture, swine is where I see the most opportunity for education and support. </p>
